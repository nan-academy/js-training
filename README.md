[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeromelegrand/js-training.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeromelegrand/js-training)
## Setup
First, [**fork**](https://github.com/nan-academy/js-training/fork?fragment=1) this repository.
### globals dependencies
install globaly node on your computer

```sh
# download your code locally
git clone https://github.com/GITHUB_LOGIN/js-training.git
# don't forget to remplace GITHUB_LOGIN by your github login

# change working directory to the newly cloned repository
cd js-training

```

## Testing
Once you have coded your masterpiece, you can start to test your solutions.

You may either use our test tool to check all files
```sh
# run the test runner
./tester
```
![output-tester](https://github.com/nan-academy/js-training/blob/master/img/output-tester.png)

Or you can run only a some tests with
```sh
# run the test runner with args ( basics, advanced, math, get)
./tester basics
```
Or you can test files one by one with node
```sh
# open a file in node
node exercises/primitives
```
![output-node](https://github.com/nan-academy/js-training/blob/master/img/output-node.png)

*our tester may include bugs, feel free to check the code and fix it*

(in doubt use node)

## Solving
You can start editing the javascript files with your favorite text editor.
```sh
# Sublime Text
subl primitives.js

# VSCode
code primitives.js

# Vim
vim primitives.js

# I can not be held responsable if you use anything else.
```

## Get Help !
We maintain an example based code documentation

All you need to know to solve those exercises is described in them.

_(*) methods in italics are **NOT** pure (using them with the same arguments won't return the same result).
They must be used with caution as it is harder to predict their results_

## Update
We may update tests, to apply them fetch and merge the master branch back to
your branch.

```sh
git merge pull push branch checkout origin master stash pop
```

## Test Style
We recommand to use [`editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/#download) to
auto-config your editor to match the coding style

We also made an `.eslint` rule to help you formating your code.

You may want to use [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) and [`prettier-eslint`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint) for painless application of
the style

## Automated test
We recommand to use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) to automatise the testing phase, allow this repo and add this code in your README
`[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GITHUB_LOGIN/js-training.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GITHUB_LOGIN/js-training)`
by remplacing GITHUB_LOGIN by your github login

## Contribute
We greatly recommand you to add your own tests to this list

- add your test file *(ex: `exercises/my-test.js`)*
- edit `package.json` and add `"my-test"` to the `"tests"` array with the syntax `{"tag": X, "name": NAME}` where you replace the tag (x) and the name (NAME)
- make a pull request !`https://github.com/nan-academy/js-training/compare/master...GITHUB_LOGIN:master`

*All the tests must be written using [assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html)
for `./tester` to work properly.*
